# Lambda Racing

This will be a simple old school racing game written in [haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) using the
[gloss](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) library.

Right now this is just a test and no actual game is available yet.

## Compile and run

cabal install  
cabal build  
cabal run

## Playing

Move the 'car' with the left and right arrow keys. Press ESC to exit game.
